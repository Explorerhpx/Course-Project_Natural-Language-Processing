This project is the Homework3 of [DATA130006](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zywei/DATA130006/index.html)

## Introduction
* In this assignment, students are required to use **sequence labeling models** for Chinese event extraction;
*  Event information are defined as two parts:
  * Trigger: the main	word that	most clearly expresses the occurrence of an event.
  * Argument: an entity, temporal expression or value	that plays a certain role in the event.	
* The Dataset comes from the *financial news*, which is available at the course [website](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zywei/DATA130006/index.html)
* All codes related to HMM need to be implemented by student him/herself without reffering to any other package or existing codes
