# Chinese Event Extractioon
This project is the Homework3 of [DATA130006](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zywei/DATA130006/index.html)

## Introduction
* In this assignment, students are required to use **sequence labeling models** for Chinese event extraction;
*  Event information are defined as two parts:
    * Trigger: the main	word that	most clearly expresses the occurrence of an event.
    * Argument: an entity, temporal expression or value	that plays a certain role in the event.
* This task is separated as two subtasks:
    * Trigger labeling: identify the trigger word in the sentence, and classify it to 8 types
    * Argument	labeling: identify all the arguments in the sentence, and classify them to 35 types
* Students are required to use both **HMM** and **CRF** models for this task.
* You can use any toolkit (but not python package) for their implementation
* The Dataset is available at the course [website](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zywei/DATA130006/index.html)
* All codes related to HMM need to be implemented by student him/herself without reffering to any other package or existing codes
