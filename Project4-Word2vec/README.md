# Spell Correction

This project is the Homework4 of [DATA130006](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zywei/DATA130006/index.html)

Students need to finish the coding part and the Assignment4

## Introduction for coding part
* In	this	assignment, students will need to use **word2vec** models for sentiment analysis;
* Each sentence in our data has a sentiment label to represent its sentiment level;
* This task is separated as two subtasks:
    * Word2vec: use **word2vec model(Skip-gram in this task)** to train your own word vectors, and **visualize** your word vectors;
    * Sentiment analysis: use the average of all the word vectors in each sentence as its feature, train a **classifier**(e.g. softmax regression) with **gradient descent method**;
* The Dataset is the *Stanford Sentiment Treebank(SST) dataset*, which is available at the course [website](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zywei/DATA130006/index.html)
